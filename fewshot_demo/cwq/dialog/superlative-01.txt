Q: What zoo that opened earliest is there to see in Dallas, TX?
Thought: Let's first decouple this complex problem into several simple sub-problem triples: (target zoo, locate in, "Dallas, TX"), (target zoo, opened, earliest). According to my knowledge, the entity name of "Dallas, TX" in Freebase may be "Dallas". Next, I need to search a node meaning "Dallas".
Action: SearchNodes("Dallas")

Thought: "Dallas" with "Dallas is a major city in Texas" is the node I want. Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "locate in" in the sub-graph.
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e ns:type.object.name "Dallas"@en . ?e ns:common.topic.description ?desc . FILTER regex(?desc, "Dallas is a major city in Texas") }', semantic="someplace to see")

Thought: "travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions" is the predicate I want. Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "zoo" in the sub-graph.
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e0 ns:type.object.name "Dallas"@en . ?e0 ns:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions ?e . }', semantic="zoo")
Observation: [("South Africa", zoos.zoo_exhibit.zoo, ?e), (?e, zoos.zoo.exhibits, "Orinoco Avian Trail"), (?e, zoos.zoo.opened, "1888"^^xsd:gYear), (?e, zoos.zoo.category, "Zoo"), ("Zoo", zoos.zoo_category.zoos, ?e), (?e, zoos.zoo.memberships, "Association of Zoos and Aquariums"), ("Bonnie Pitman", architecture.museum_director.museum, ?e), (?e, architecture.museum.established, "1993-10"^^xsd:gYearMonth), (?e, architecture.museum.type_of_museum, "Art Gallery"), ("Dallas Cowboys", sports.sports_team.arena_stadium, ?e)]
Thought: "zoos.zoo.opened" is the predicate I want. Now, I have all the information I need. I can construct the SPARQL query. 
Action: ExecuteSPARQL('SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?e0 ns:type.object.name "Dallas"@en . ?e0 ns:common.topic.description ?desc . FILTER regex(?desc, "Dallas is a major city in Texas") ?e0 ns:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions ?x . ?e ns:zoos.zoo.opened ?num . } ORDER BY ?num LIMIT 1')
Observation: ['Nasher Sculpture Center']
Thought: The observation is the answer I want.
Action: Done.
