Q: Who won the noble peace prize in 2007 and held his governmental position from 1-3-1977?
Thought: Let's first decouple this complex problem into several simple sub-problem triples: (target people, win, Nobel Peace Prize), (target people, wining time, 2007), (target people, hold governmental position from, 1-3-1977). According to my knowledge, the entity name of "noble peace prize" in Freebase may be "Nobel Peace Prize". Next, I need to search a node meaning "Nobel Peace Prize".
Action: SearchNodes("Nobel Peace Prize")
Observation: ['"Nobel Peace Prize" | Description: The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the five Nobel Prizes created by the Swedish industrialist, inventor...', '"1996 Nobel Peace Prize" | No description.', '"1997 Nobel Peace Prize" | No description.', '"1998 Nobel Peace Prize" | No description.', '"1999 Nobel Peace Prize" | No description.', '"2000 Nobel Peace Prize" | No description.', '"2001 Nobel Peace Prize" | Description: The 2001 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the United Nations and Kofi Annan for "their work for a be...', '"2002 Nobel Peace Prize" | Description: The 2002 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Jimmy Carter "for his decades of untiring effort to find p...', '"2003 Nobel Peace Prize" | Description: The 2003 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Shirin Ebadi for "her efforts for democracy and human righ...', '"2004 Nobel Peace Prize" | No description.']
Thought: "Nobel Peace Prize" may be the node I want. Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "win" in the sub-graph of the entity "Nobel Peace Prize".
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e ns:type.object.name "Nobel Peace Prize"@en }', semantic="win a award/be honored")
Observation: [("Yasser Arafat", award.award_winner.awards_won -> award.award_honor.award, ?e), ("Refugee", award.award_winning_work.awards_won -> award.award_honor.award, ?e), ("1994 Nobel Peace Prize", award.award_ceremony.awards_presented -> award.award_honor.award, ?e), (?e, award.award_category.winners -> award.award_honor.honored_for, "Refugee"), (?e, award.award_category.winners -> award.award_honor.award_winner, "Yasser Arafat"), (?e, award.award_category.winners -> award.award_honor.ceremony, "1994 Nobel Peace Prize"), ("1960 Nobel Peace Prize", award.award_ceremony.nominees -> award.award_nomination.award, ?e), (?e, award.award_category.winners -> award.award_honor.year, "1994"^^xsd:gYear), ("Vladimir Putin", award.award_nominee.award_nominations -> award.award_nomination.award, ?e), ("Nobel Prize", award.award.category, ?e)]
Thought: "award.award_category.winners -> award.award_honor.award_winner" is the predicate pair I want. Next, I need to find the time when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded. According to the observation, "award.award_category.winners -> award.award_honor.year" is the predicate pair I want. Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "hold governmental position from" in the sub-graph.
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e0 ns:type.object.name "Nobel Peace Prize"@en . ?e0 ns:award.award_category.winners ?c . ?c ns:award.award_honor.award_winner ?e . }', semantic="hold governmental position from")
Observation: [(?e, government.politician.government_positions_held -> government.government_position_held.from, "1882-01-01"^^xsd:date), (?e, government.governmental_body.members -> government.government_position_held.from, "1946"^^xsd:gYear), (?e, government.political_appointer.appointees -> government.government_position_held.from, "1902-02-01"^^xsd:date), (?e, government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials -> government.government_position_held.from, "1979"^^xsd:gYear), (?e, government.politician.government_positions_held -> government.government_position_held.to, "1884-12-31"^^xsd:date), (?e, government.governmental_jurisdiction.government_positions, "Member of the European Parliament"), (?e, government.governmental_body.members -> government.government_position_held.to, "1946"^^xsd:gYear), (?e, government.political_appointer.appointees -> government.government_position_held.to, "1906-04-01"^^xsd:date), (?e, government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials -> government.government_position_held.to, "1999"^^xsd:gYear), (?e, government.governmental_body.offices_positions, "President of the United Nations General Assembly")]
Thought: "government.politician.government_positions_held -> government.government_position_held.from" is the predicate pair I want. Now, I have all the information I need. I can construct the SPARQL query.
Action: ExecuteSPARQL('SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?e0 ns:type.object.name "Nobel Peace Prize"@en . ?e0 ns:award.award_category.winners ?y . ?y ns:award.award_honor.year ?year . FILTER(xsd:datetime(?year) >= "2007-01-01"^^xsd:dateTime) FILTER(xsd:datetime(?year) <= "2007-12-31"^^xsd:dateTime) ?y ns:award.award_honor.award_winner ?x . ?x ns:government.politician.government_positions_held ?c . ?c ns:government.government_position_held.from ?from . FILTER(?from > "1977-01-03"^^xsd:dateTime) }')
Observation: ['Al Gore']
Thought: The observation is the answer I want.
Action: Done.
